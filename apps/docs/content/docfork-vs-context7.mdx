| Feature                  | **Docfork**                                | Context7                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Stack scoping (Cabinets) | **Project-level**, free                    | Org-wide allowlist                 |
| Team collaboration       | **Free:** shared Cabinets & API keys       | Pro plan ($10/seat)                |
| Content                  | **Full docs** + `fetch_url` for full pages | Documentation sections             |
| Approach                 | **Search + read** (iterative)              | Resolve → query (two-step)         |
| Tools                    | `query_docs`, `fetch_url`                  | `resolve-library-id`, `query-docs` |
| Token optimization       | **Adaptive** 500–100k tokens               | Fixed \~3k tokens                  |

## The problem

You prompt: `"How do I set up authentication?"`

Your agent returns results from NextAuth, Clerk, Auth0, Better Auth, Supabase Auth — even though you only use one. That's context bloat, and it leads to hallucinated code.

Without project-level scoping, there's no way to tell your agent "this project uses Hono, not Express" or "Drizzle, not Prisma." The query is ambiguous, so the results are too.

## The fix: Cabinets

A Cabinet is a lockfile for your docs context. Define your stack once, and every query returns only docs from those libraries.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docfork": {
      "url": "https://mcp.docfork.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "DOCFORK_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "DOCFORK_CABINET": "my-saas-app"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This Cabinet contains `vercel/next.js` + `drizzle-team/drizzle-orm` + `better-auth/better-auth`. Now _"how do I set up authentication?"_ returns Better Auth docs — because that's what's in your stack.

Your whole team uses the same Cabinet. **Same context, every engineer.**

## Switch in 60 seconds

Replace your Context7 config:

```diff
{
  "mcpServers": {
-   "context7": {
-     "command": "npx",
-     "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
+   "docfork": {
+     "command": "npx",
+     "args": ["-y", "docfork@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then [create a Cabinet](/core/cabinets) with your stack and add the `DOCFORK_CABINET` header. Done.
