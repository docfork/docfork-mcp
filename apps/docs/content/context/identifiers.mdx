Docfork indexes libraries using a `owner/repo` identifier format. Using these identifiers in your prompts helps the Agent skip the "discovery" phase and query the exact documentation index immediately.

## Syntax

The identifier follows the GitHub-style format:

```text
owner/repo

```

## Usage in Prompts

When you know the library you are using, append the identifier to your prompt.

**Standard Prompt:**

<Conversation>
  <Message role="user">How do I use auth?</Message>
  <Message role="agent">
    <Action>calling `query_docs` with query: `auth` and library: `auth`</Action>
    Results may include Auth0, Clerk, NextAuth, or other authentication libraries.
  </Message>
</Conversation>

**Targeted Prompt:**

<Conversation>
  <Message role="user">Implement auth using `better-auth/better-auth`.</Message>
  <Message role="agent">
    <Action>
      calling `query_docs` with query: `auth` and library:

      <br />
      `better-auth/better-auth`
    </Action>
    Results are focused exclusively on the Better Auth library.

  </Message>
</Conversation>

## Finding Identifiers

You can find the identifier for any supported library in two ways:

1. **Direct use:** If you already know the `owner/repo`, pass it as the `library` value.
2. **GitHub URLs:** Extract `owner/repo` from GitHub links in results and reuse it as `library`.
3. **The Catalog:** Browse our [Library Catalog](https://docfork.com/search) to find the exact ID for your dependencies.
