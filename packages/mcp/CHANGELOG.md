All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-12 — Sharper tools

### Added

- `query_docs` results now include a description field so your agent picks the right doc before fetching
- `fetch_url` **supports partial paths** (e.g. `/docs/01-app`) and returns a table of contents with chunk previews. Full chunk URLs remain the default for reading content.
- `readOnlyHint` annotations on all tools for safer client auto-approval

### Changed

- **Rewrote and compressed both tool prompts** with shorter descriptions, structured format, and good/bad contrastive examples
- Scoped `fetch_url` to URLs from `query_docs` results only
- Unified stdio and HTTP into a single transport. Less config, fewer moving parts so contributions are now easier to make.
- Search results return descriptions only. Leaner context window, fewer wasted tokens
- Consolidated release publishing into one workflow and switched npm publishing to GitHub OIDC trusted publishing (tokenless)

### Removed

- OpenAI-specific endpoint. Standard MCP transport covers all clients now, including OpenAI. One path to maintain, zero edge cases.

- Stateless HTTP transport — removed `MCP-Session-ID` management to reduce overhead and latency
- Enabled `enableJsonResponse` for faster non-streamable requests
- Request body size limits for security

- `/mcp` endpoint remains fully supported for API key authentication (backward compatible)
- Code formatting and readability improvements
