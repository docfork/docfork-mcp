Last updated: Feb 2026

Keeping your engineering workflow secure matters. This page explains how Docfork handles data today and how to evaluate risk for your environment.

## How Docfork handles data

Docfork is a documentation retrieval service for AI coding agents.

- We index and serve documentation sources
- We store workspace metadata (such as Cabinets and API key metadata)
- We do **not** require access to your source repository to use core Docfork MCP functionality

## Upstream providers

Docfork uses upstream infrastructure and service providers to operate the product.

Common provider categories:

- Cloud infrastructure and networking
- Authentication and identity
- Logging and monitoring

If you need a provider review for procurement or legal, contact us and we can share the latest provider list and details for your workspace.

## Data we store

- Workspace settings
- Cabinet definitions and associated library identifiers
- API key metadata (key names, creator, timestamps)
- Usage counters and rate-limit tracking

## Data handling guarantees

- API keys are stored securely and should be treated as secrets
- Cabinet scope limits documentation retrieval to the libraries you define
- Least-privilege access and operational controls are used for internal systems

## Security roadmap

We are actively improving our security posture on the path to broader enterprise support.

Current priorities:

- More detailed provider transparency
- Expanded security documentation and controls reporting
- Stronger enterprise-facing governance features

## Vulnerability disclosure

If you believe you found a vulnerability, please email:
