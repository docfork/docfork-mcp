## Overview

A workspace is the home for your team's shared context - [Cabinets](/core/cabinets), [API keys](/core/authentication), and usage. We recommend one workspace per organization so everyone stays aligned on the same stack and keys.

## Workspace settings

To open workspace settings, go to **[Settings](https://app.docfork.com/workspace/team)**.

**Members** can create and manage Cabinets and API keys.

**Admins** can also:

- Rename the workspace
- Add or remove members

## Members and roles

| Role   | Access                                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin  | Create and manage Cabinets and API keys; edit workspace settings; invite and remove members |
| Member | Create and manage Cabinets and API keys                                                     |

<Callout type="info" title="Member limits">
  Free tier includes up to **5 members** per workspace.
</Callout>

## Shared context across your team

When everyone shares the same Cabinets and keys, your agent gets consistent answers:

- **Cabinets**: one stack definition, reused by the whole team
- **API keys**: shared keys for MCP access; no per-user setup
- **OAuth**: optional workspace quick-setup for teams without provisioning keys

New members can start with the same defaults immediately - no drift between environments.

## Multiple workspaces

You can create or join multiple workspaces under a single account. Each workspace has its own member list, Cabinets, API keys, and billing - even when you access them from the same account.

Use multiple workspaces when you work across different organizations or want to keep personal and work contexts separate.

To switch workspaces, click your workspace name in the app and select **Switch workspace**.
